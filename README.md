# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a Peaceful Resort Application built using React.js.

## Features

In this application, users can explore all rooms in the resort. They can book rooms according to their requirements. The application allows users to filter rooms based on size, type, pet allowance, breakfast availability, and room price. Users can navigate between different pages and view the services provided by the resort. Additionally, they can see the details of a particular room. After booking a room, users can proceed to make payments. For state management, I utilized the Context API, and for routing, I implemented `react-router-dom`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors may appear in the console.
