# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a Peaceful Resort Application built using React.js.

## Features

In this application, users can explore all rooms in the resort. They can book rooms according to their requirements. The application allows users to filter rooms based on size, type, pet allowance, breakfast availability, and room price. Users can navigate between different pages and view the services provided by the resort. Additionally, they can see the details of a particular room. After booking a room, users can proceed to make payments. For state management, I utilized the Context API, and for routing, I implemented `react-router-dom`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors may appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is then ready to be deployed. Refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you full control over them.

You don't have to use `eject` if you don't want to. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
